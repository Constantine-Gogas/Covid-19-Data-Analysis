# Covid-19-Data-Analysis

## Covid-19 Data Exploration and Visualization

This project was created in order to explore and visualize data on Covid-19 for my university class. The dataset was found on the website "Our world in data". In this project I answered four questions with SQL queries and uploaded the final dashboard on Tableau Public.

## Questions:

1.	Global Numbers
2.	Total Death Count per Continent
3.	Total Infection per Country
4.	Percent Population Infected
